### Data Overview

The data for this project was sourced from two datasets obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Hate Crime Dataset: The Hate Crime Statistics dataset consists of 226,000 rows and 28 columns, with a size of 4.57MB. It provides annual statistics on reported crimes motivated by bias against the victim's perceived race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. The data captures information on incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders.

Human Trafficking Dataset: The Human Trafficking dataset contains 3,099 rows and 19 columns, with a size of 83.3KB. It includes data on offenses related to commercial sex acts and involuntary servitude. The dataset encompasses information on offenses and arrests recorded by state and local agencies that report this crime to the national UCR Program. The collection of Human Trafficking data by the UCR Program began in 2013.

These datasets serve as the foundation for the insightful visualizations and analyses presented in the project. Users can access the datasets at the following link: [Download Datasets](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads)
